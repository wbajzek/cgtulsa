I got this book recently on interlibrary loan after having read my teacher's copy in the past. It's been out of print for a long time, and I have heard unsubstantiated rumors that it may be printed again, but I find that to be highly unlikely. But there's a lot of wisdom in it, and although the writing is a bit florid, the key points are given in careful detail<br /></div>
