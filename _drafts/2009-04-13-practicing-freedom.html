I guess that a practical example musically is that legato vs staccato should be a choice, not a habit, and if you are practiced well enough with the forms of articulation, you can better maintain your awareness of what you are actually doing and have the freedom to make choices.<br /><br />I like this mindset. We all know the old quote about how a professional practices so that he can’t get it wrong, and we have all heard a million times “the performance was technically perfect, but lacked emotion/spontaneity/etc.” I would think that it is better to have practiced with the goal of facilitating freedom, rather than hammering away at an interpretation until it is immutable.<br /><br />http://www.delcamp.net/forum/en/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=31230&p=320268#p320268<br /><br />This freedom kinda gets to the core of the age old “debate” of technique versus emotion. The real problem is when interpretation, even when deeply rooted in emotion, is practiced so carefully that it becomes immutable and the performer loses the ability to have or respond to spontaneous urges. The really inspiring performances, I believe, are the ones where the artist has the freedom to follow those urges and the control to do so with clarity. I’ve always found the technique v. emotion debate to be really annoying, because I know that it must be possible to have both. I think the key to cultivating those lies in the mindset one adopts while practicing.<br /></div>
