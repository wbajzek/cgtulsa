* set metronome to short time values to help solve technical problems<br />* learn to play a phrase as one gesture rather than a series of notes/events<br />* practice one-octave scales with metronome clicking on first note and the octave<br />* set it to one click per bar or longer if possible to develop phrasing</div>
