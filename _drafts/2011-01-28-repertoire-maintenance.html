I've got a few performances coming up in the Seattle area. One of the gigs is a background music thing at which I plan to play a  somewhat different set of music, and another is a guitar duo  performance, so there's also a completely different set of music for  that!<br /><br />It's been a fun challenge for me to put together and maintain so  much repertoire at once. I've never really had to do it before. And it's a drop in the bucket compared to what professionals have to contend with. After all, Jason Vieaux said in <a href="http://guitarsalon.com/blog/?p=1132">an interview with Guitar Salon International</a> that he's had to perform up to 9 hours(!) of repertoire in a single season. <b><br /></b><br /><b>&nbsp;</b>The "how-tos" for this have been covered time and again by others, so I thought I'd focus on some thoughts I have about it. <br /><br /><b>Observations on learning and maintaining repertoire</b><br /><br />The guitar duo repertoire took the least time to learn and takes the least effort to maintain and improve. It's also somewhat easier, but not so much as to explain that.<br /><br />We perform with sheet music so there's less worry about memorization, although I think we both have the majority of the music fairly well memorized by now whether we realize it or not. <br /><br />Part of it is that we managed to get a gig very soon after we started working together. Because of that, we chose repertoire that was realistic for us to learn in that time frame. Having a deadline is a good way to prioritize and focus on the work that needs to be done.<br /><br /><b>Music is easier when it's fun</b> <br /><br />Working with a partner to learn and shape the music under a bit of time pressure made it a lot more fun for me, and caused me to switch off all the self-doubt and general 'noise' that goes on in my head when I am learning music. <br />&nbsp;</div>
