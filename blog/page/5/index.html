  <div class="entry-content"><p>Philip Hii&#8217;s been <a href="http://philiphii.com/2011/01/rhythm/">writing about rhythm a lot on his blog</a> lately, and so I feel like it&#8217;s a good time to work on my rhythm (it&#8217;s always a good time to work on rhythm). I think I have pretty good rhythm, but I would rather <strong>leave no room for doubt</strong> about it.</p>

<p>I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Music-Lesson-Spiritual-Search-Through/dp/0425220931?ie=UTF8&tag=willisguitabl-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969">Victor Wooten&#8217;s excellent book &#8220;The Music Lesson&#8221;</a> (thanks to <a href="http://www.dougyoungguitar.com">Doug Young</a> for the recommendation!) in which he discusses 10 fundamental aspects of musicianship in ways that I think are not often dealt with. He&#8217;s a jazz bassist, of course, and the book is written somewhat from that perspective, but pretty much all of it applies in one way or another to any other kind of music and instrument. I&#8217;ll write up a review of it at some point, but for now&#8230;</p>

<p>Victor Wooten offers some interesting exercises for working on rhythm in &#8220;The Music Lesson,&#8221; and there&#8217;s a nice video on Youtube where he demonstrates some of them.</p>

<p>Watch this:</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9X1fhVLVF_4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p><strong>Applying this to classical guitar</strong>
I&#8217;ve taken La Catedral: Allegro Solemne and prepared the following example. The accent marks show where the metronome should click in relation to the music. The first example is how I typically feel the piece; the next two are a bit harder and then the rest are even<strong> </strong>harder.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/catedral-accents.png"></p>

<p>For each one, start by counting out loud so the click lines up with the right beat. Victor demonstrates in the video. For a lot of us that will be a great exercise in and of itself.
Once you get that going, start playing the example on the &#8220;one&#8221; and work on it until you are comfortable with the beat placement. Then, if you know the rest of the piece, continue on and see how far you can keep time with the metronome on that beat. Or, apply it to a piece that you do know.</p>

<p><strong>If you can make it through the whole thing without losing the beat, I salute you!</strong></p>

<p>The rest of us should persist with it until we can.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t yet get all the way through the piece this way, but after an hour of working this way, I found that I was playing with a rhythmic clarity that I hadn&#8217;t realized I was lacking before. But I also found that I could play way faster than usual without any tension, and barely made any mistakes. In fact, I felt like the music was playing itself!</p>

<p>Why? As Victor says, when you work on this exercise, you&#8217;re no long just playing along with the metronome. <strong>The rhythm has to come from within you. </strong>It&#8217;s one thing to feel like you&#8217;re playing in time, and another to know with absolute confidence that you are. The metronome will tell you.</p>

<p>I would be surprised if anyone who tries and sticks with these exercises doesn&#8217;t have a similar result. It just makes sense to me&#8230; It IS a mentally taxing exercise, but it&#8217;s aimed directly at improving the most fundamental of musical skills.</p>

<p>You might not like hearing this, but the more difficult and frustrating these exercises are for you, the more likely it is you <strong>really</strong> need them. The upside is, you will be really glad you did!</p>

<p>Also, feel free to start with simpler music, I just chose what I happened to be working on this morning.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://philiphii.com/">Philip Hii</a> has been putting up a series of posts about speed and fluidity on his &#8220;Art of Virtuosity&#8221; blog recently. They&#8217;re all great, so go check them out (when you&#8217;re done reading this post!).</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a section in his <a href="http://philiphii.com/2011/01/rebound/">&#8220;Rebound&#8221;</a> post that I wanted to look at:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you find that you’re not rebounding quickly or that you’re  hampered by a lack of speed in your plucking, you might want to check if  lack of fluidity could be the culprit.</p>

<p>Make sure that as you play, you do not stop the finger at any point,  especially when you have to rebound ie. change direction to bring it  back to playing position again.</p>

<p>If you are, try moving the fingers <i>upward</i> after you pluck and rebound in a circular trajectory as described above. You might be surprised by the results.
Fluidity is at the heart of all efficient movement and is absolutely crucial for speed and power.</p>

<p> -Philip Hii</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that a lot of times teachers try to convey to students that they shouldn&#8217;t pluck the strings upwards away from the top of the guitar, which is something that a lot of people instinctively do for fear or getting &#8220;stuck&#8221; on the next string. &#8220;Don&#8217;t pluck upwards&#8221; can eventually get thought of as &#8220;there shouldn&#8217;t be any upward motion.&#8221;</p>

<p>But somehow you have to clear the string on the way back to playing position, and I think that no matter how you conceptualize it, there will need to be some upward motion. Following Philip&#8217;s advice will help you understand the whole motion you&#8217;re working on rather than leaving some of it to chance.</p>

<p><strong>Bicycling exercise </strong></p>

<p>What Philip talks about reminds me of something I read in Pepe Romero&#8217;s &#8220;Guitar Style and Technique&#8221; book. Sadly, it is long out of print and I have only been able to borrow it, so I will just paraphrase; Pepe recommends, as an exercise, moving your right hand fingers in circles as through you&#8217;re pedaling a tiny bicycle.</p>

<p>I have seen it said that this motion should be &#8220;avoided at all costs,&#8221; presumably because if you pluck the string upward, you will get a thin and weak tone&#8230; but if you already know how to make a good sounding stroke, it shouldn&#8217;t be a problem to coordinate the motion so that the upwards portion doesn&#8217;t begin too soon.</p>

<p>Which brings me too&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Always have a positive musical intent</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to work on technique by itself but it always helps to have a musical intent when you do it. I have noticed at times that I can play, for example, scale passages faster in a piece than I could when practicing scales on their own. The<strong> perception of difficulty</strong>  often makes things harder than they really are because when we focus on what we don&#8217;t want to happen. If you focus instead on what you <strong>do </strong>want, you&#8217;ll probably get it quicker.</p>

<p>PS: I have several upcoming gigs in the Seattle area, although the only gig that&#8217;s really &#8220;public&#8221; is at the  Burlington, WA public library from 2-3pm. But for those of you attending  the recital-type performances, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m playing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rodrigo: En Los Trigales</li>
<li>Turina: Fandanguillo</li>
<li>Villa-Lobos: Prelude 3</li>
<li>Barrios: Julia Florida, La Catedral</li>
<li>Bach: Cello Suite BWV 1009</li>
<li>Llobet: Plany</li>
</ul>


<p>At at least two of these performances, there will be a piano present, so with my wife <a href="http://www.angeline-leleux.com/">Angeline</a> I&#8217;ll also be playing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vivaldi: Trio Sonata rv82</li>
<li>Rodrigo: Españoleta (from Fantasia Para Una Gentilhombre)</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Concerts undoubtedly have great value in developing the student technically and mentally; but too often they have a directly contrary effect. I think there is a very doubtful benefit to be derived from the present habit, as illustrated in New York, London, or other centers, of the student attending concerts, sometimes as many as two or three a day. This habit dwarfs the development of real appreciation, as the student, under these conditions, can little appreciate true works of art when he has crammed his head so full of truck, and worn out his faculties of concentration until listening to music becomes a mechanical mental process. The <em>indiscriminate</em> attending of concerts, to my mind, has an absolutely pernicious effect on the student.&#8221;</p>

<p>-Albert Spalding, from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15535">&#8220;Violin Mastery&#8221; by Frederick Martens, 1919</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s difficult for me to imagine a world where one could attend two to three concerts <strong>a day</strong>, but now we could just substitute &#8220;listen to your iPod.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Immersion is important</strong></p>

<p>After all, listening to music is fundamental for a musician, in order to develop a sense of style and continuity.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s really easy now to listen to music all day long, and to get into the habit of listening passively. You may be fooling yourself into thinking you&#8217;re picking up on the details when you&#8217;re not. It&#8217;s not a big step to go from &#8220;listening passively&#8221; to &#8220;barely listening at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Listening to yourself while you practice and perform is crucial to success. When you&#8217;re accustomed to &#8220;barely listening at all&#8221; to music, you may find it hard to listen to yourself while you play, especially if you are already struggling with confidence issues.</p>

<p><strong>You have to REALLY listen!</strong></p>

<p>I discovered about year ago that I was sort of bracing my ears as I played, hiding from the sounds I was making. I found that when I wanted to play something loudly, I ended up not really hearing it at all. It was a total shock to realize this, but it explained a lot about how different my music actually sounded from what I wanted to it to sound like.</p>

<p>I decided to take drastic (and almost painful) action. For several months, I stopped listening to music almost altogether. The only exception was when I could give all my attention to the music. I would sit on the floor in front of the stereo and listen to one piece at a time, following along in the score whenever possible. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://imslp.org/">imslp.org</a> and <a href="http://www.muslib.se/ebibliotek/boije/indexeng.htm">the Boije Collection</a> are a great resources for this.)</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t prepared for how quiet and weird my world became, compared to what I was used to. Almost immediately, though, I became aware of all manners of subtleties in the music that I listened to that I had never heard before. I began to hear what makes an interpretation work or not. I began to open up my ears to my own music again, and appreciate how much I really wasn&#8217;t hearing.</p>

<p><strong>That doesn&#8217;t sound like me!</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard so many people say (and I&#8217;ve said it myself) that they&#8217;re surprised by what they really sound like, when they listen back to a recording they&#8217;ve made of themselves. If you don&#8217;t hear what it really sounds like <strong>while</strong> you&#8217;re playing, you need to work on your listening skills.</p>

<p>Recording yourself is a helpful and important tool (and I encourage it), but it&#8217;s not a substitute for being present in the moment while you&#8217;re playing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some food for thought today culled from Louis Drouët&#8217;s 1830 method for playing the flute. I left the pre-Victorian ESL wording alone, because I find it amusing, but the advice is good:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>On the Method of Finishing a Piece</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;The word finish, as employed here, means to bring to perfection. Thus to finish a piece is to labour at it, until it is executed with much purity in the style, as well as neatness in the execution.
&#8220;To finish a piece, the question is not to play it to the end, to begin it again afresh and then tune and to continue thus for several days in succession, hoping to bring it to perfection by an execution of this kind. By such a mode of proceeding men become blinded to the piece which they study; they conclude by playing with coldness, and by executing the passages with rapidity, but without neatness; they become habitual to the defects of execution, which occur in the difficult passages, so much so, that they are unfelt by the performer though they strike the ears of his audience in the most glaring manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;The following is the shortest method to learn well and speedily, a piece of music that is to be performed in public.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is necessary in the first place to play it once or twice successively, to have a true conception of its general effects. Of the degree of movement which is best adapted to aid it, and in a word that which tends most to identify it with the composer. After this first operation, should be recommenced slowly, a pause should be made at every period, every phrase, and even at every bar; all the details should be laboured with the greatest ease till the performer has acquired the tact of giving the composition every degree of elegance, grace, and dignity; and to display the brilliant passages with the most striking neatness, energy, and splendour. Afterwards from time to time the piece should be performed as if it were executed before the public.&#8221;</p>

<p>-Louis Drouët, London 1830</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Breaking rules for the sake of breaking rules isn’t usually art; it’s just anarchy. And following rules for the sake of following rules is just mindless conformity.</p>

<p>-David duChemin, <a href="http://www.pixelatedimage.com/blog/2011/01/dont-break-the-rules/">&#8220;Don&#8217;t Break the Rules&#8221;</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For a while now, I&#8217;ve been following photographer David duChemin&#8217;s blog. This recent post from him really hit the nail on the head. I think the kind of expression a lot of guitarists have come to equate with &#8220;soul&#8221; is what duChemin aptly calls &#8220;anarchy.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Communicating with the audience</strong></p>

<p>An expressive performance creates, <strong>for the listener</strong>, the feeling that the composer and/or performer wants them to experience.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean holding a chord a bit longer, hitting some note louder, speeding up, or slowing just because you&#8217;re trying to &#8220;express yourself&#8221; and that&#8217;s how you feel it. That might fool a superficial listener, but it&#8217;s not going to hold up in the long run.</p>

<p>There are certain conventions that have evolved over the course of music history in order to accomplish this goal of creating an effect for the listener. This is where ritardandi, rallentandi, accelerandi, accent, dynamics, etc come in to play. This is <strong>phrasing</strong>.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t understand these things and aren&#8217;t using these things appropriately, there&#8217;s a very good chance you&#8217;re not really communicating with your audience effectively.</p>

<p>If these things are applied too clinically or carefully, they may still fail to communicate fully, but they will probably still produce a more convincing performance for the audience than when they are used &#8220;intuitively&#8221; but inappropriately.</p>

<p>duChemin offers some great advice, too, for the artist or musician who wants to develop a genuine sense of expression. Think &#8220;musical expression&#8221; when he says &#8220;photographic expression&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote><p>Art created in adherence to rules is art about rules, not about passion or beauty or any other thing about which humans have made honest art over the centuries.</p>

<p>That’s not to say there aren’t helpful principles, but they are only that. They’re guides to help us make our decisions, but divorced from the Why, separated from the reason they became rules in the first place, they’re more a shackle than a permission to experiment and express. I know the usual response to this discussion is that you have to know the rules first, then you can break them; I think that’s baloney too. <strong>Just knowing the rules is useless. We need to understand the principles of photographic expression, the reasons these rules came into play to begin with in the first place, then use or ignore them in the service of our vision as we need.</strong></p>

<p> -David duChemin</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>A mercifully brief rant</strong></p>

<p>I started thinking about writing this post when I watched William Kanengiser play <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiIjg_Gw98c">Sor&#8217;s B minor etude</a> and read the comments:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is dry to﻿ say the least. He plays Sor with an<br/>
Art Deco approach&#8230;.beautiful tones and longlines.<br/>
Lacking all the Accelerandi,Rallentando,and<br/>
varying beat placement,dynamic contrast,and as<br/>
you say &#8230;color contrast&#8230;.it is totally unsoulful.</p>

<p>-smithsherman</p></blockquote>

<br/>


<blockquote><p>like a midi</p>

<p>-loadermen</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, anyone capable of listening to this recording objectively will hear plenty of accelerandi,  rallentandi, and everything else smithsherman claims are not there. These things are not even subtle, and sometimes they&#8217;re pretty dramatic.</p>

<p>So why are they undetectable to loadermen, smithsherman, and the 56 thumb-uppers? It&#8217;s no wonder classical guitarists in general still have a poor reputation compared to other musicians.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s often said that you get used to recording by recording more. While that&#8217;s kind of true, it&#8217;s not very helpful to look at it that way. If you feel miserable every time you record, recording 100 times isn&#8217;t likely to make you happy.</p>

<p>It can be helpful is to frequently use recording as a tool. Don&#8217;t worry about takes being &#8220;keepers&#8221; because none of them have to be. Try recording just a phrase at a time, listen back and work on the details.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll eventually start to get  used to it and be able to perform better when that red light is on. As  you get comfortable working this way, try longer sections of pieces. Gradually work your way up to recording whole pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Mistakes: Chicken or egg?</strong></p>

<p>Fear of mistakes is usually what stresses people out about recording, and ends up being the cause of those mistakes. Strengthening your memory and practice techniques will help you cope with this, but you need to work on your attitude about the process, too.</p>

<p>Give yourself permission to make mistakes and remind yourself of why you  play in the first place. Hopefully you&#8217;re doing it because it&#8217;s fun and  you love it. It&#8217;s great to feel proud of your accomplishment, but if  you play because you have something to prove, you&#8217;re setting yourself up  for a world of struggle.</p>

<p>You need to break the vicious cycle of &#8220;I&#8217;m worried I&#8217;ll make a mistake. Oops, I made a mistake. Now I&#8217;m even more worried about it&#8230;&#8221; Mistakes will help you learn.</p>

<p>Make a distinction between transient errors like missed notes and  errors of judgment like unclear phrasing and missing dynamics. Technical goofs happen and can be prevented, but often times they happen because of vague musical idea. You should definitely learn to clean up your technique bue also be really clear about what you want to do and present in your playing.</p>

<p>Of course, it sometimes just comes down to plain old insufficient preparation. Well, at least you&#8217;ve learned what you need to work on in order to be able to record it well. Instead of getting stressed about it, make note of what you need to work on, take a break, and then dive back into practicing.</p>

<p><strong>Other approaches</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes the recording process itself can be a big source of distraction. Some suggestions for dealing with that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Devote some time to working out your recording setup without trying to get a good performance. Once you find a sound you like, just leave your equipment set up, or figure out how to set it up easily. I worked out my &#8220;best quality&#8221; setup so I can be ready to record in about 5 minutes. For my day to day recording, I just set my edirol on the table in front of the guitar and forget about getting ideal placement.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t bother stopping and starting your recorder in between takes, especially if it&#8217;s digital. You can trim out the stuff you don&#8217;t want later. Just get it going and start playing. If you want to do another take, just allow yourself some time to relax and start another. I find that stopping and starting the recorder in between takes turns into an opportunity to act out frustration and it can quickly become a downward spiral. Just let it roll.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t try to do a ton of takes of one piece in a row. If it&#8217;s not happening after a few takes, take a break or record something else for a while. You can always come back to the first.</li>
</ul>


<p>PS: Speaking of recording, I&#8217;ve been looking forward to <a href="http://guitarsalon.com/blog/?p=689">Marc Teicholz&#8217;s &#8220;Valseanna&#8221;</a> since GSI first announced it. I&#8217;d held off on buying it because I hoped that they might make it available for download, and lo and behold, it&#8217;s now available on iTunes! This is a really sweet album, 18 waltzes played on 18 vintage guitars, although I&#8217;m not quite sure how Pepe Romero, Jr&#8217;s 2004 guitar counts as vintage. I heard Teicholz play a few times when I lived in the SF Bay Area and really enjoyed it every time. He&#8217;s such an unpretentiously expressive player. Check it out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some videos which are somewhat buried on Youtube, that I find inspiring and insightful. Both feature Pepe Romero and Joaquin Rodrigo, a look into their working relationship, and a bit of the creative process behind these works.</p>

<p>The first offers some background about the famous Concierto de Aranjuez.</p>

<iframe class="youtube-player" frameborder="0" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yNE2-JBdJlM" title="YouTube video player" type="text/html" width="480">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;My &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</iframe>


<p>This one is in Spanish. My spanish is weak but I was able to follow most of it well enough (at least until they get to the part about astronauts). It&#8217;s about Concierto Para Una Fiesta, which is one of my favorite guitar concertos. It&#8217;s not nearly as well known as the Aranjuez but to my taste, it&#8217;s even better.</p>

- Kenny Werner, Effortless Mastery.</p>

<p>In Effortless Mastery, Kenny Werner tells the story of his falling in love with music, being overwhelmed and hitting to rock bottom in music school, and how he picked up the pieces and put them together to become the master musician he is today.</p>

<p>He also gives you a clear, but thoroughly humbling, path to developing your own mastery of music.</p>

<p>It also comes with a CD with the author guiding you through four meditations with a veil of reverb and over a backdrop of tinkling piano. This can be really off-putting for some people (certainly for me, at first) but it&#8217;s an essential part of his method and a very effective one at that.</p>

<p>Think of it as an attitude adjustment which most of us genuinely need. For me, it really helped break the cycle of frustration, to relax and enjoy the process.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t base your self-esteem of your music</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s really easy for a lot of us to get frustrated with ourselves when we fail. A lot of us try to play music that&#8217;s too hard for us, or we want to play faster before our muscles develop the necessary coordination. Sometimes we prepare difficult music inadequately for performances and when the performance don&#8217;t live up to our expectations, the aftermath can feel really awful.</p>

<p>Werner wants us to free ourselves from our judgment (there&#8217;s a time and place for judgment, and it&#8217;s not in the middle of a performance!), expectations, and desires  - especially desire to be great, to improve, to not suck for just a few minutes&#8230; and open our ears and accept the sounds we are actually making. From this mental space of humility, honesty, and acceptance (yes, even of mistakes), we can begin to make progress.</p>

<p><strong>Steps to Mastery</strong></p>

<p>He presents a method for focused practicing that I won&#8217;t describe, because you should really read the book and hear about it first hand. It is a humbling process, but from it, real progress can be made&#8230; and it can be applied to anything you work on.</p>

<p>You may be surprised at how fast or slow this progress comes, but you can be sure that it is genuine, and that&#8217;s the best part. In time, you will be able to rely on yourself to perform your music perfectly, effortlessly, and without thought.</p>

<p><strong>It works</strong></p>

<p>This seems like quite an idealistic path but it is actually pretty realistic. We really can&#8217;t force yourself to improve any faster than we&#8217;re ready to, but there are a million obstacles we can set up for ourselves that will slow it down. Effortless Mastery is a simple plan for freeing ourselves of those obstacles.</p>

<p>The ideas in this book are not totally new or unique, but I like the way they are distilled to a simple and clear path. I think that most books in this genre say essentially the same things, but they say them in different ways, and some may resonate better with some readers than others. I will review others that I have read  when I get a chance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tracking progress is a popular topic on guitar blogs I read. With all the day-to-day ups and downs, the best advice is to measure progress over the long term. Set some goals and work on them.</p>

<p><strong>Keep revisiting something easy</strong></p>

<p>Something you can do that is really fun and rewarding is to revisit your easiest repertoire. It&#8217;s tempting, and OK, to leave the stuff behind as you progress. It&#8217;d be great to fully master every little bit of music before you move on, but there are so many facets of even the simplest music that you&#8217;d probably get overloaded or bored if you tried to do it all at once.</p>

<p>But hold on to that music. Pick something easy (preferably something you learned early on) <strong>pull out the music and play it a few times every 6 months or so</strong>. Even better, record it every six months and listen to your earlier recordings after you record it again. Compare them, see what has improved and what hasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Notice how your phrasing has changed, notice how you start to make choices about things that you never even noticed before.  If you recorded it, notice how your tone and timing improve.</p>

<p><strong>Use it as a pick-me-up</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes when I&#8217;m having rough day, I like to pull out something really familiar, like some simple Sor studies, and play them for a while. It helps me let go of my frustration and remind me of how good I&#8217;m able to sound. Then when I go back to my current music, I feel refreshed. It&#8217;s a way of recalibrating.</p>

<p>That reminds me of something jazz bassist Sean Malone once said to me (or maybe I read it in an interview? I forget)  to always start off practicing with something really easy that you can  nail every time. It will set the tone for the rest of your practice.</p>

<p>PS: I&#8217;ve rereleased another old recording of mine, <a href="http://glissant.bandcamp.com/album/november">November</a>. It&#8217;s an ambient electric guitar looping album I recorded about 10 years ago. If any of those words sound interesting to you, give it a listen :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some things you practice may require a lot of repetition to train your muscle memory. It&#8217;s tempting to just keep repeating an exercise thinking you&#8217;re going to build up strength, but little errors will compound and turn your playing to mush.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an effective way to get things done:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a <strong>clear idea</strong>  of what you&#8217;re trying to do before you start. If you don&#8217;t know what it should sound like, ask your teacher to demonstrate or find a recording of a piece which uses that technique.</li>
<li>Set your metronome to a speed where you can do the exercise as closely to that ideal as possible. When in doubt, err on the slow side.</li>
<li>Play the exercise a few times. Do it for maybe 10-15 seconds and stop. It&#8217;s important, at this point, <strong>not to worry about how it sounds</strong>.</li>
<li>Take a break for a 10-15 seconds and relax. Recall that clear idea of what the exercise your playing should sound like.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 a few times, for about five or ten minutes.</li>
<li>Take a longer break. 2-3 minutes. <strong>Put the guitar down, stand up, think about something else for a bit.</strong></li>
<li>Recall that ideal again. Repeat steps 3-6 until you run out of time or are ready to move on.</li>
</ol>


<p>In your next practice session, begin again at step one. The trick is to do it as much as possible in the time you have, but take little breaks so you stay focused and don&#8217;t get tired. The breaks also give things a chance to sink in.</p>

<p>PS: I was recently contacted by another guitarist in town who saw my craigslist ad and liked my recordings. He sent me a link to his youtube channel and I liked his playing, so now we are working on duets together. Our first gig is December 8th at the Anacortes Museum, wish us luck!</p>
