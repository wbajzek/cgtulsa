  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, I am working on a project to make a video every day (when possible) for the rest of April 2011. I&#8217;m having a <strong>great </strong>time with it, and heartily encourage others to give it a try. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/wbajzek#grid/user/CCBF8167D9AD5621">Here&#8217;s a link to my Youtube playlist for this project</a>. I invite you to subscribe to my channel!</p>

<p>Here is my process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose a piece (or related pieces), preferably something relatively simple and unfamiliar to me. They will very in difficulty but will need to be short enough to not require page turning, and should not have more than a few technical difficulties.</li>
<li>Record myself sightreading it.</li>
<li>Analyze the result; make note of any difficulties, determine interpretation.</li>
<li>Isolate technical issues and practice</li>
<li>Refine interpretation</li>
<li>Record again and post!</li>
</ol>


<p>The audio will be somewhat close-mic&#8217;d (2-3 feet away) and will remain unprocessed.</p>

<p>The end result probably won&#8217;t be perfect, but one thing I have learned from performing is that at some point you just have to let the music out into the world. The sooner and more often, the better.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just started, but here are some random things I have learned or been reminded of so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recording yourself is good, especially with video, but doing it frequently is even better. The feedback you get is incredibly helpful.</li>
<li>Give yourself a deadline every now and then to help you focus. A recital, open mic, video recording, etc.</li>
<li>I need to pay more attention to my right hand fingerings. I&#8217;m surprised by how much I repeat fingers, although left to its own devices, my hand will start alternating once it becomes necessary to achieve the necessary speed.</li>
<li>Left-hand positioning is really important. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s one universally &#8220;perfect&#8221; position, but if you&#8217;re making a shift (for example) make sure you land in a position that&#8217;s advantageous for what you&#8217;re about to play.</li>
<li>You can learn a lot about your playing by watching your face while you play.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Take a piece like Villa Lobos&#8217;s Prelude #3, and compare several recordings of it to the score if you have it. There is a sort of &#8220;traditional&#8221; interpretation of this piece, in which performances tend to follow a similar (to each other) contour of dynamics and rubato, to the point where the rhythms you will hear no longer really resemble what the composer notated.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a similar sort of tradition with Sor&#8217;s famous B minor study, Opus 35 #22. My copy of &#8220;Complete Sor Studies&#8221; has the tempo marked Allegretto. Every 19th century copy I&#8217;ve seen of the piece says Allegretto&#8230; Yet there seems to be a contest amongst performers to be give the slowest performance of it.</p>

<p>That study clearly works well when played slowly. Sor could have written &#8220;Andante&#8221; and no one would have thought differently of it. <strong>But he didn&#8217;t.</strong> So does everyone who plays it slowly do it because they spent time with the piece and decided slow was best? Or was it because that&#8217;s what they were used to? Maybe Segovia&#8217;s edition has a slower tempo marking.</p>

<p>Prelude #3 works just fine when played with that particular pattern of rubato. But I was actually surprised when I read through it the first time, that some of the written rhythms were so different from what I was used to hearing and I can&#8217;t help but think that if HVL would have written them differently if that was what he really wanted. We should at least consider that. Somehow I doubt that everyone that plays it that way studied the score, and chose to play it exactly that way because of the contents of the score.</p>

<p>We can get so accustomed to hearing a certain type of interpretation  of a piece that when played strictly as written it sounds amazingly  wrong. Don&#8217;t be afraid to play something differently from how it&#8217;s written, if that&#8217;s what moves you, but <strong>consider whether you&#8217;re making your own artistic choices or letting someone else do it for you.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We need to develop technique so we can communicate with our listeners. We often get caught up in what is cool, or difficult, or whatever, but that&#8217;s not really worth much if it doesn&#8217;t help us communicate.</p>

<p>We can work endlessly on scales, arpeggios, slurs, tremolo, etc, but that&#8217;s just where technique starts. Real technique is attention to the details that make the music come alive. Virtuosity is mastery of the details of those details.</p>

<p>Listen to some great flamenco guitarists, and notice when they buzz  notes. It&#8217;s not random and it&#8217;s not merely because of the setup of their  guitars. It&#8217;s integral to the feel of the music. You learn that by listening.</p>

<p>Listen to when a singer or flute player breathes, and the sound of the breath. That&#8217;s part of the music.</p>

<p>As a fan and player of irish music, I can&#8217;t tell you how obvious it is  when I hear someone who thinks that all there is to the music is playing  the notes. I could learn flamenco falsetas from a book but to a real flamenco afficionado it&#8217;s just going to sound like a classical guitarist reading the notes. It has to have the right feel, and you learn that by listening.</p>

<p>When people say &#8220;music is in the space between the notes,&#8221; they don&#8217;t just mean the rests. They mean that the notes are one of many aspects of music, and they all require our attention.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>But actually, doing what other people expect you to is what’s overrated. The  external rewards for pursuing a dream may or may not arrive, but  regardless, you should feel proud of doing so. The first steps are more  important than the later ones, because they’ll provide inspiration and  security for everything that comes later. Just keep walking!</p>

<p> Never despise small beginnings, and don’t belittle your own  accomplishments. Remember them and use them as inspiration as you go on  to the next thing. When you venture outside your comfort zone, wherever  the starting point may be, it’s kind of a big deal.</p>

<p>I recently commented on <a href="http://christopherguitar.com/">Chris Davis</a>&#8217;s post <a href="http://www.classicalguitarblog.net/2011/03/the-missing-ingredient-no-one-likes-to-talk-about/">&#8220;The missing ingredient no one likes to talk about&#8221;</a> that of all the musicians I&#8217;ve known, we classical guitarists seem like the least likely to get out and perform. We also complain about lack of public interest, diminishing ticket sales, etc. I bet these things are related.</p>

<p>If you love classical guitar and you play classical guitar, you should get out there and perform.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s not worth it if you can&#8217;t sell out an auditorium. Don&#8217;t feel like nobody will want to see you if you don&#8217;t have a degree or haven&#8217;t won a competition. Don&#8217;t worry about trying to impress people.</p>

<p>Just have fun and do your best. You don&#8217;t have to blow everyone&#8217;s mind, just make someone smile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After giving a house concert in Seattle a few weeks ago (big thanks to <a href="http://rich-golf.blogspot.com/">Rich</a> for hosting!), once of the audience members said to me, &#8220;that Bach suite must have taken forever to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve written about my experience learning this suite (BWV 1009) in the past and I&#8217;d sum it up by saying that I&#8217;ve tried every memory and visualization trick in the book on it and I&#8217;ve never had so much trouble with memorization with a piece. It didn&#8217;t go badly in performance, but I needed the music in front of me to feel confident that I could stay on track.</p>

<p>So I responded, &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ll still be learning it when I&#8217;m an old man. If I could start over again with it and do one thing differently, <strong>I would study it a lot more before trying to play it</strong>.&#8221;
Sometimes it&#8217;s tempting to get into practice mode before music is properly studied and learned. In this case, the piece superficially appears &#8216;easy&#8217;;  it&#8217;s mostly one note at a time, fairly easy to read, somewhat (deceptively) formulaic, and because of my  listening history, it&#8217;s very familiar.</p>

<p>But I was tricked by that sense of  familiarity into believing I had studied it enough. I clearly skipped head, because as time went on, I kept finding areas where I wanted to change my fingerings to get things across better.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s sort of where the problems started showing up. Better fingerings are, well, better, but what happens when you change fingerings? If you&#8217;ve been practicing the old way for a while, you&#8217;ve now practiced two ways of doing it. <strong>How do you make sure you&#8217;re going to do it the right way when it comes time to perform?</strong></p>

<p>Thorough study at the beginning of the learning process, finding the best solutions and committing to them early on, seems like the best way to head this problem off at the pass.</p>

<p>There will be cases where you need to change a fingering, but you need an effective brainwashing strategy (please share!) or it may be better to make note of your new way but then leave it alone until you&#8217;ve had a chance to put the piece down for a while and look at afresh.</p>

<p>PS: Speaking of making changes, my wife Angeline and I are moving to Tulsa over the next month or so. She leaves in mid-April, after which my life will get quite boring. So I&#8217;m planning to make a series of videos between then and the end of April or so, in which I work on a short piece for a day and then film &amp; post it. My main focus will be on musicality, but I have a few other goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn to pull together pieces and interpretations more quickly</li>
<li>Produce a demo CD to send to senior centers and other gig venues</li>
<li>Watch my movements, facial expressions, etc, and learn what I can from them</li>
<li>Get more comfortable with recording.</li>
</ol>


<p>I&#8217;ve posted the first video already, mainly as a technology test. I hope to achieve better quality video in the future, but that may not happen until I can afford a real video camera. I&#8217;m pleased with the quality of the audio, though. The description on the youtube page describes my setup.</p>

<p>My hope is that I&#8217;ll enjoy this project, learn a lot from it, and want to keep it up in the long run.</p>

<p>I read &#8220;Casals and the Art of Interpretation by David Blum around the time I started this blog and have been meaning to write about it ever since. It&#8217;s a treasure-trove of wisdom about music, and also paints a lively picture of Pablo Casals, sprinkled with quotes and anecdotes that bring to life the character from which the wisdom springs.</p>

<p>Although a lot of musicianship can be broken down into guidelines to follow, it&#8217;s the individual that makes them into music.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Casals&#8217; views represent a particular school of thought that I think is not considered universal today. A lot of his recommendations go against what&#8217;s said Anthony Glise&#8217;s &#8220;Classical Guitar Pedagogy&#8221; book, to give an example of a book guitarists will run into which deals with interpretation. I&#8217;m not saying either is &#8220;the right way&#8221; of doing things.</p>

<p><strong>Phrasing</strong></p>

<p>One thing that is highlighted in the book is the importance of the phrasing of musical lines. This comes more naturally to singers and people who play monophonic instruments, but most guitar music involves multiple simultaneous lines and we need to shape those independently.
The typical (and rightly so) advice is to consider these lines individually and sing them out loud. Casals suggests that within each line, the sound should get louder as the notes ascend, and quieter as they descend. This probably doesn&#8217;t mean that phrases should usually have a wide range of dynamics, but that they sing out in a natural way.</p>

<p>The downside with guitar music as it is printed is that more often than not, we are not given phrasing slurs and in the clutter of fitting multiple voices on one staff, the phrasing can often appear ambiguous. I used to naively assume that they would follow the bar lines and consequently ended up with music that sounded very flat and dull. Then I learned that phrases often begin before the bar line, and are often longer than a bar.</p>

<p>The best ways to deal with this is to work on your music with an experienced teacher and to listen to a variety of high-level performers playing music and follow along in the score. It doesn&#8217;t have to be (and shouldn&#8217;t always be) guitar music. If you&#8217;re interested in Casals, for example, you could <a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=casals">listen to him on archive.org</a> and you can probably find the scores on <a href="http://imslp.org/">imslp.org</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past weekend I went to the <a href="http://seannos.org/">Sean Nós Northwest</a> festival at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA, and played an awful lot of irish flute. This festival is a great celebration of Irish language, song, and dance, and so there were few instrumentalists there but we were treated with especially great respect and gratitude by the dancers.</p>

<p>It was especially fascinating to me to watch how a room full of 20-30 dancers could lock into rhythm with each other and with the music. I got the feeling that one could learn this kind of dance more easily by listening than by watching or thinking.</p>

<p>At the festival, we also watched a film called &#8220;Come West Along the Road,&#8221; which consists of archival footage of musicians, singers, dancers, etc. I was really struck by a segment which, conveniently, is also on YouTube:</p>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AQE3AS3Vzb0?fs=1" width="425"></iframe>


<p>I was kind of amused at first by his one-finger-per-hand style of guitar playing. How much easier and more straightforward could it get?</p>

<p>But then I realized that I have no idea how much work this guy put into the guitar part, because he seems so unconcerned with it that you can&#8217;t even call it an afterthought. But it&#8217;s just there for him, perfectly steady, as natural as walking.</p>

<p>What he&#8217;s playing is really simple, but I really admire the conviction with which he plays it and the complete effortlessness of it. There&#8217;s really nowhere to hide in something like that.</p>

<p>One more thing; not to turn this into a giant group hug but there&#8217;s more than meets the eye in any performance and even a failed one is probably the result of an honest effort. Let&#8217;s be sure to give credit where credit is due.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Peter Mitchell commented on <a href="http://williamsguitarblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/you-have-to-really-listen.html">my &#8220;You have to really listen&#8221; post</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think this is related to the discussion around &#8220;multitasking&#8221;.  I  think the idea that you can passively listen, which implies focusing on  other things, and still fully experience the music is definitely not the  case.  Multitasking is somewhat of a myth when you look at how our  brains actually function.  Something always has to take priority when it  comes to assigning attention.  So in this case, it needs to be the  music.  Otherwise, I think you are missing out on a lot that you don&#8217;t  even realize.</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree, and I think that what I encountered in <a href="http://williamsguitarblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/what-do-you-focus-on.html">my previous post</a> was that <strong>sometimes putting a lot of effort into &#8216;focusing&#8217; can be a distraction from what you&#8217;re actually doing.</strong></p>

<p>You have to listen to what you&#8217;re playing, and you have to know how to  actually play it, but my experience has been that conscious control, especially in performance, can lead to the opposite effect.</p>

<p>In other words, I play  my best when I can just let go and trust myself. It&#8217;s not always an easy thing to do; at least not yet.</p>

<p>How do you learn to trust yourself?</p>

<p><strong>Prepare thoroughly</strong></p>

<p>Learn the music correctly from the beginning. Understand it before you play it. Practice it regularly and efficiently. Don&#8217;t practice mistakes; focus on solutions before repetitions.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t get too far ahead of yourself</strong></p>

<p>Plan to perform mostly music that is within your reach. It&#8217;s good to push yourself a bit so you can grow, but if your whole program consists of music you can only occasionally perform well, you&#8217;re setting yourself up for disappointment.</p>

<p><strong>Play with your eyes closed</strong></p>

<p>Playing with your eyes closed will tell you how well you really know a piece, but if you&#8217;ve been playing for a while and you haven&#8217;t tried it before, you might find that you can do it better than you expected. I think it helps cultivate a better physical understanding of the instrument as well as an aural experience of the music.</p>

<p><strong>Take a leap of faith</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes, in spite of your best efforts, you may end up in a situation where performance day is nearly upon you and things haven&#8217;t all come together<strong> </strong>the way you wanted. At that point, the best thing you can do for yourself is decide to just have fun and do your best.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s harder than it sounds, but it is absolutely possible. <strong>You have to make the choice and commit to it.</strong> You have to make that same choice at some point even when you&#8217;re well-prepared, because performing in front of people is a different skill than preparing in private, and it&#8217;s a different skill than practicing performing or performing for a recording.</p>

<p>PS: My recent bunch of gigs were really fun! I had a duo gig with Jason on Thursday, solo recital Saturday afternoon, fundraiser solo/duo recital with my wife Angeline Saturday evening, and then a house concert in Seattle on Tuesday night. At the last one, I got to play in front of a roomful of guitarists, which is usually the hardest thing but it felt great.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a real privilege to play for an audience that understands the music and the effort that went into preparing it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I managed to smash my left middle finger in the bathroom door on Monday night. I&#8217;m not sure how it happened, but I came out of it with a small cut and a numb fingertip. Yuck!</p>

<p>So I decided to take it easy on practicing the next day and just play through my Bach Cello suite for fun. I sat down to play and got into my &#8220;I&#8217;m concentrating!&#8221; mode, and soon enough things were going &#8230; well, not great.</p>

<p>Frustrated, I decided to put the guitar away and do something else for a while. But I got bored and came back to the guitar to work on one of the movements that didn&#8217;t go right. I started by playing through it again, and a funny thing happened.</p>

<p>I got distracted somehow and found myself thinking I should start working on my taxes. Suddenly, I noticed that I was playing <strong>great.</strong> Huh? I played a few whole of the suite as well as I&#8217;d like to play them in concert.</p>

<p>Thinking about my taxes is probably not the magic recipe for success, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that lightening up and letting go is part of it.</p>

<p>What do you focus on when you perform? Listening to the sound? Visualizing what&#8217;s ahead?</p>
