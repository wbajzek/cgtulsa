<p>I have to say, I miss the concert halls in the SF Bay Area. Petit Trianon and Herbst theater had really great acoustics, but I am not impressed with Benaroya Hall in Seattle. It just doesn&#8217;t work as well for guitar.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to make a point of recording myself more often and getting comfortable in front of a mic, so I am planning to record something at least once a week when possible. Today, I sat down with my book of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mel-Bay-Complete-Studies-Guitar/dp/1562229478?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=willisguitabl-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">Sor Studies</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=willisguitabl-20&amp;l=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969&amp;o=1&amp;a=1562229478" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important; padding: 0px ! important;" width="1" /> and recorded a few that I have worked on occasionally. I&#8217;ve never really tried to memorize these studies, but I have worked on more than half of them in the book and I like to just come back to them from time to time and apply whatever new things I&#8217;ve learned since the last time. They&#8217;re perpetually works in progress for me, but I am not particularly interested in performing them so I just use them to see how I&#8217;m doing. There&#8217;s always something new to discover in them, and there&#8217;s an awful lot of them, so I consider it one of the best bang-for-buck guitar books I&#8217;ve ever bought.</p>

<p>My recording setup and my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Direct-Sound-DIRECT-EX-25-EXTREME/dp/B0010HHEEM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=willisguitabl-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">Extreme Isolation Headphones</a> let me listen to myself as the mic hears me even as I&#8217;m playing, because the sound of the guitar in the room doesn&#8217;t bleed through so much into the headphones. Normally, I hate that, because it sounds weird without the room acoustics. But I realized today that it&#8217;s a handy tool for practicing, as well; it lets you hear what you&#8217;re doing approximately as an audience would. It makes it obvious how much you need to exaggerate things like tone color changes, dynamics, etc in order to get them across to the listener.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s today&#8217;s recording:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is from <a href="http://theteemingbrain.wordpress.com/interview-with-thomas-ligotti/">an interview with Thomas Ligotti</a>, a modern horror writer who&#8217;s one of my favorite authors. I think that what he has to say about writing a story applies just as well to the process of composing or studying and performing music:</p>

<blockquote><p>I’ve always had to know enough about the story I’m going to write and be  enthusiastic about it to make it worth the bother to write the thing in  the first place. So I meditate on it, make tons of notes, ask myself if  there is something missing from the story that should be there or  something that’s there and shouldn’t be, and rack my brain to take the  idea of the story to the farthest limit it will allow. Satisfied that  the story will be worth writing, I start writing it. In the process, I  usually come up with better ideas than I had originally planned. If that  didn’t happen, the story would only be adequate, as a number of my  stories have been. It’s not possible to plan every metaphor and  structural aspect ahead of time, of course. I’ve had to trust that my  abilities in these areas won’t let me down.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s another interesting quote from his answer to the preceding question.</p>

<blockquote><p>Then I read Poe and Lovecraft for the first time and found what I didn’t  know I was looking for: writers who put themselves on every page of their work, who wrote like personal essayists and lyric poets. Every fiction writer I’ve ever admired wrote in this manner.</p></blockquote>

<p>A lot of emphasis gets put on respecting composers&#8217; intentions and  studying scores carefully, but in the end most of the the best and most  widely respected and listened-to performers are known better because they put themselves into everything that they play. If you compare Barrueco and Williams playing a piece, I am sure they both are attempting to convey the meaning of the score, but in the end they always sound like themselves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Heitor Villa-Lobos&#8217;s Prelude 3 for about 3 months now. You can hear this morning&#8217;s recording of it in my previous post; usually I play it twice (as written) but it&#8217;s a tricky piece to pull off that way. I read a quote recently (I think) from Antigoni Goni, which I can no longer find, where she said something to the effect of, &#8220;when part of a piece repeats, just as we are all changed by the passage of time.&#8221; I think she&#8217;s a real master of this idea, by the way; I am very fond of her recordings and it sounds to me like she never plays anything the same way twice. Every repeated section has some new facet or insight.</p>

<p>Back to Prelude 3. This is an oddly formed piece in which the entire thing repeats, and the second page of it repeats as well; the long pedal segment gets repeated four times if you play it all as written. What is one to do with that?</p>

<p>Another interesting thing is that yesterday I sat down with the score and listened to nearly a dozen recordings of it, not a single one plays it exactly as written, rhythmically. Note values are lengthened, shortened, etc, in the extreme. I&#8217;m not talking about a little rubato; I mean, sometimes what is written as a half note gets played as an 8th or 16th. Furthermore, if one DOES play it exactly as written, it sounds kind of flat. Some parts sound rushed, others will sound like they come in very late.</p>

<p>The question is, what did HVL intend when he wrote it? Did he mean for it to be played so romantically, but wrote it the way he did to make it fit the notational constructs properly? Or has the tradition of playing it romantically overshadowed what&#8217;s written in the score? Of course, there are segments were, dynamically, many performers do the exact opposite of what the composer calls for, and it&#8217;s hard to make the case that they are following his intention that way.</p>

<p>The point I am getting at is, what&#8217;s most important? The composer&#8217;s intention or the performer&#8217;s own style? I&#8217;m not so sure that&#8217;s even what really matters; I think the most important thing is that the performer is convinced by the interpretation they use and the audience will pick up on that and it will communicate the them. Otherwise, if the performer is unconvinced, how can the audience be?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I felt like I needed to do some recording, to try to get more gigs, so I started working on that this week. Recording guitar is tricky, especially at home and on a limited budget. I record using my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Roland-Edirol-R-09HR-High-Resolution-Recorder/dp/B002UI2W8S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=willisguitabl-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">Edirol R-09HR</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=willisguitabl-20&amp;l=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002UI2W8S" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important; padding: 0px ! important;" width="1" />, which is incredibly handy and easy to use. I think it&#8217;s a great field recorder, but I haven&#8217;t been happy with its internal mics for recording guitar. Let&#8217;s face it, the guitar&#8217;s just not all that loud, and so you either need very sensitive mics, or you need to mic the instrument really closely. These things have resulted in too much background noise, or an unnatural guitar sound.</p>

<p>A few months ago I bought a pair of <a href="http://www.naiant.com/xwspecification.html">Naiant X-W</a> mics, which are very affordable and sound great. I have had great success with them for recording flute and fiddle, and recently, my wife&#8217;s piano trio (piano, violin, cello). These are pretty loud instruments, though, which the guitar isn&#8217;t. I was still running into the same problem; I had to mic the guitar pretty closely, or get too much background noise. This recording of En Los Trigales was done that way; the mics are about 20 inches away from the guitar, spaced about 6 inches (which, having only one stand, is all I can manage at this point). It is pretty good but, given the mics sensitivity, the echo of my room became a problem on the staccato passages. I masked this a bit by using some digital reverb; in this case, it was TC Electronic&#8217;s free M30 reverb. In hindsight, I think I used too much and I don&#8217;t think it sounds very natural. Once upon a time, I had a TC Electronic G-Force, and their PerformanceVerb reverb plugin and loved them. I hate to say it, but I don&#8217;t think the newer plugin sounds as good.</p>

<p>Today, I did some more recording with a different setup; I switched to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/CAD-M179-Variable-Pattern-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B0002D0N70?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=willisguitabl-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">CAD m179</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=willisguitabl-20&amp;l=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0002D0N70" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important; padding: 0px ! important;" width="1" /> mic, set to the hypercardioid pickup pattern. This is a very sensitive mic with a fairly flat response (compared to other mics I have owned), and using this pickup pattern I was able to avoid some of the echo from the side walls. This let me move the mic back to about 3.5 feet away, and I think it picked up the full range of the guitar very clearly without problematic background noise or room echoes.</p>

<p>I was skeptical about recording the guitar in mono, even though I am really fascinated by mono recordings. I knew it could be done but until today I&#8217;d never achieved a satisfactory sound that way. In this case, it does sound a bit brighter than I think my guitar actually sounds, but I left that alone, figuring it would just help make the recording clear. It picked up the bass really nice, I think.</p>

<p>I used digital reverb again; this time, the free <a href="http://audio.lernvall.com/">Lernvall Audio LAConvolver</a> plugin with an impulse response file recorded in a church somewhere. I am really pleased with how this round of recordings turned out; unfortunately it still suffers from ambient sounds, like cars driving by and stuff, but for demo purposes, that&#8217;s OK. Such is life. I actually had to call it a day as the garbage truck arrived and I knew that the rest of the morning was going to be filled with beeping and crashing noises.</p>

<p>The following two tracks in this post were recorded with this setup. I plan to do more soon, and will experiment further&#8230; I may be able to get away with moving the mic a little further away from the guitar, which would help tone down things like nail noises and string squeaks which would not be so prominent in a performance anyway.</p>

<p>I will continue posting clips to my Soundcloud page as I complete them.

I&#8217;m just crazy about this guitar, and love playing it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I gave a couple of solo performances this past weekend, for the first time in a few years. They went great! The first was as background music for a reception at my local library. It sort of fell out of the sky for me, was a nice warm-up opportunity for me as it happened to be on the night before my scheduled recital. Aside from the incredible hospitality of my hosts, I had some nice comments from the attendees, and found that many of them gathered around me rather than away from me. Always a good sign! Background music gigs are sometimes a bit awkward but I was made to feel very welcome.</p>

<p>The following day, I played at the Burlington, WA public library&#8217;s concert series. I had seen <a href="http://www.noteworthyduo.com/">Noteworthy Duo</a> there a few months ago, and felt like it was a surprisingly great place to perform. It has a very welcoming atmosphere and great acoustics. I am a big believer in the intimacy of live performances and would generally prefer a house concert over a large hall any day, and this place has a living room -like feel to it with acoustics that allow you to hear the music clearly anywhere in the large room.</p>

<p>I played the following program:</p>

<ul>
<li>J. S. Bach: Cello Suite 3 BWV1009</li>
<li>Heitor Villa-Lobos: Etude 1</li>
<li>Heitor Villa-Lobos: Prelude 3</li>
<li>Agustin Barrios Mangore: La Catedral</li>
<li>Leo Brouwer: Dos Aires Populares Cubanos</li>
<li>Joaquin Rodrigo: En Los Trigales</li>
</ul>


<p>Aside from the Barrios and Rodrigo, these were all pieces that are new to me as of this year. How did they go? Well, I really like the Brouwer pieces but they didn&#8217;t seem to fit, somehow. Perhaps they would have been better before La Catedral, to break up the mood a bit, but I have to admit, they just don&#8217;t feel like &#8220;my&#8221; pieces. I no longer plan to keep them in my concert repertoire. Brouwer is one of my favorite composers, though, and very influential to my approach to the guitar, so his music will continue to play a role in my repertoire.</p>

<p>I had actually prepared Rodrigo&#8217;s Sonata a la Espanola, as well, and I wish now that I had played it. The main reason that I didn&#8217;t was that somehow I managed to go well over-time before I got to it, which is odd because with it, I had clocked my rehearsal performances at 61 minutes. It means that a bit of tuning and a few brief words in between pieces and perhaps a some slower than intended tempi filled up more time than I would have guessed. On the other hand, I still felt a little uneasy about the last movement of the Sonata, and everything that I did play I was able to play with total conviction.</p>

<p>I suppose that is one of the big differences between these performances and the ones I did several years ago; I haven&#8217;t necessarily studied this music for as long, but I have done so more thoroughly and confidently than before. Part of that comes from the experience I have amassed in the years since, but a lot of it is a change in approach, too.</p>

<p>I have come to understand and appreciate in a deep way, the importance of one&#8217;s frame of mind while studying, practicing, listening, and performing. This is a direct influence of <a href="http://www.guitar69.com/">Kevin Gallagher</a> on me and he writes about it quite a bit on his blog. I think that for me it boils down to the fact that I can have an understanding and intention in mind before I play, and I can look back critically on what I played, but when I play I need to just trust myself to do what I have trained to do. In essence, I played these two performances the same way I play irish flute in social situations ((non-jam) sessions), which is that I listened and enjoyed the music while my body did the work for me.</p>

<p>I think that this is what all accomplished performers do, and is kind of a prerequisite to real musical communication, which I believe I was able to achieve at least some of the time. Everything I have read or heard about performing well can be rephrased or interpreted in this way. For me, it&#8217;s something new; I have been working on it all year and started finally breaking through the inner-critic and other barriers I&#8217;ve set up over the years and I&#8217;m happy to say that these were the best solo-guitar performances I&#8217;ve ever given because I was able to listen to and enjoy every note I played as clearly as if someone it was someone else playing it for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just read <a href="http://kc0dxf.net/serendipity/index.php?/archives/18-Jorge-Caballero-Concert-and-Workshop.html">a nice blog post</a> from <a href="http://kc0dxf.net/blog/">Bob Wooldridge</a> about a concert and workshop given by <a href="http://www.jcaballeroguitar.com/pages/index.php">Jorge Caballero</a> at the GFA convention. There was a nice quote in it:</p>

<blockquote><p>The workshop started out with Jorge simply asking if anyone had any technical problems that they would like to discuss. But I believe that Jorge was engaging in a somewhat Socratic attempt to shake up our thinking. Several things were suggested as technical problems. Tension, scale velocity, tone, etc.. but Jorge&#8217;s answer was that these were not really technical but musical. In other words, almost all technical problems are fundamentally musical in nature!</p></blockquote>

<p>In fact, my teacher <a href="http://guitar69.com/">Kevin Gallagher</a> said pretty much the same thing to me in my lesson today. I really believe it, and for me it&#8217;s one of those things that I was starting to grasp and then suddenly it seems like the whole world is shouting it at me.</p>

<p>I can give a really concrete example for it. For a while I&#8217;ve felt like I just wasn&#8217;t getting out of my guitar what I knew it was capable, in terms of volume and tone. For a while I thought it was because I was trying a different nailshape and wasn&#8217;t used to it yet, or hadn&#8217;t gotten it quite right yet. Kevin pointed out to me in a lesson that I was missing some notes in faster passages, or at times they were there but not consistent with the surrounding notes. I started paying a lot more attention to the consistency of volume and tone, not so that everything was even really but so that it fit in better with the &#8220;trajectory&#8221; of the line. So if I meant to play a line at a given volume level, that all the notes fit in, or if I was making a decrescendo, that each note had the right volume and tone for its place in the line.</p>

<p>Of course it helped right away, but the best thing about this was that it made me pay a lot more attention to the sound I was producing. It made me take the time to listen to things like chords and arpeggios. Did each note in the chord have the right &#8220;weight&#8221; behind it? Did the voices within the chords sound connected to the adjacent chords, as with the single-note lines mentioned before? Without these details in place, the sound gets unfocused and deteriorates.</p>

<p>Now, this is the kind of thing that if I were to try to think about every detail while I was playing a piece, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to play it. But in practice, I could take it a bit at a time and start building the correct habit. Obviously, there was technique involved in solving these problems, but the reality is that technique wouldn&#8217;t make sense without the musical context and that educating the ear and letting the rest follow is often a much easier way to accomplish thing than to focus closely on the mechanical aspect and risk getting distracted from the result.</p>

<p>The result has been that I feel like I&#8217;m producing a lot more sound with the guitar, although the reality may be that it seems louder because the music is coming through more clearly. To use another metaphor, you could look at it like an improvement in the signal to noise ratio.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a tricky one. I have a moderate-sized collection of guitar method books, which I like because there&#8217;s always something interesting to learn from a good one. Sometimes just one new insight can make it worthwhile.</p>

<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been pondering <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Classical-Guitar-Playing/dp/0874870798?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=willisguitabl-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">&#8220;The Art of Classical Guitar Playing&#8221; by Charles Duncan</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=willisguitabl-20&amp;l=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969&amp;o=1&amp;a=0874870798" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important; padding: 0px ! important;" width="1" />which is loaded with really interesting insight and what sounds, at first glance, like advice which conflicts with other methods I have read. While many authors write about staying as relaxed as possible while playing, Duncan talks about maintaining functional tension (that is, tension which <strong>helps</strong>  your playing) and avoiding dysfunctional tension (which <strong>hinders</strong> your playing).</p>

<p>This is a bit of a paraphrase, but one specific example I can think of is where he says &#8220;an effective playing position is not so much a repose as it is an equilibrium of forces.&#8221; Meaning that he recommends that rather than finding a totally loose, passive way of holding the guitar, that you instead should use the natural springiness of the body to hold things solidly in place. However, if you were to force yourself into a position resembling the photo in the book without understanding the method behind it, you could very well end up using a lot of dysfunctional tension to maintain that position.</p>

<p>It occurred to me recently, in an email discussion with <a href="http://philiphii.com/">Philip Hii about his Art of Virtuosity books</a>, that the main differences between what these authors are saying could largely be a matter of terminology and perception. After all, if you truly eliminated all tension in your body, you would pretty much just fall down in a heap. Where one author may say &#8220;relaxed,&#8221; another may say &#8220;using balanced forces.&#8221; This shouldn&#8217;t be a big revelation but it may account for why seemingly opposite approaches can produce virtuosic results for different authors. They may not really be opposite at all, when you get down to the actual intended experience of playing.</p>

<p>This is why I think that while books have their place, the best &#8220;method&#8221; is still to find a good teacher and keep an open mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://web.mac.com/musicksmonumentbergh/audio/Pepe_Romero_&amp;_Wilhelm_Hellweg_.html">This is a recording I really love. </a></p>

<p>I was really happy to stumble upon it when I did&#8230; I don&#8217;t even remember how I found it, but I have listened to it time and time again and am always inspired by it. I hope it gets a proper CD release some day, along with the rest of Pepe&#8217;s back catalog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think that unless I have the time to devote my full undivided attention to this process, it&#8217;s probably best to work in small chunks, probably with overlap. I went for an hour-long walk yesterday and tried to mentally play through the whole Bach cello suite, but it was too hard to maintain my attention with all the sensory input of being outdoors walking around town. I found myself easily distracted by things like crossing the street and trying not to get hit by cars. :)</p>
