<a href="http://web.mac.com/musicksmonumentbergh/audio/Pepe_Romero_&amp;_Wilhelm_Hellweg_.html">This is a recording I really love. </a>
I was really happy to stumble upon it when I did... I don't even remember how I found it, but I have listened to it time and time again and am always inspired by it. I hope it gets a proper CD release some day, along with the rest of Pepe's back catalog.
