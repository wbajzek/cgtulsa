 about it. 




 for the recommendation!) in which he discusses 10 fundamental aspects of musicianship in ways that I think are not often dealt with. He's a jazz bassist, of course, and the book is written somewhat from that perspective, but pretty much all of it applies in one way or another to any other kind of music and instrument. I'll write up a review of it at some point, but for now...


Victor Wooten offers some interesting exercises for working on rhythm in "The Music Lesson," and there's a nice video on Youtube where he demonstrates some of them.

**Applying this to classical guitar**
I've taken La Catedral: Allegro Solemne and prepared the following example. The accent marks show where the metronome should click in relation to the music. The first example is how I typically feel the piece; the next two are a bit harder and then the rest are even** **harder.



For each one, start by counting out loud so the click lines up with the right beat. Victor demonstrates in the video. For a lot of us that will be a great exercise in and of itself.
Once you get that going, start playing the example on the "one" and work on it until you are comfortable with the beat placement. Then, if you know the rest of the piece, continue on and see how far you can keep time with the metronome on that beat. Or, apply it to a piece that you do know.
**If you can make it through the whole thing without losing the beat, I salute you!**
The rest of us should persist with it until we can. 
I can't yet get all the way through the piece this way, but after an hour of working this way, I found that I was playing with a rhythmic clarity that I hadn't realized I was lacking before. But I also found that I could play way faster than usual without any tension, and barely made any mistakes. In fact, I felt like the music was playing itself!
Why? As Victor says, when you work on this exercise, you're no long just playing along with the metronome. **The rhythm has to come from within you. **It's one thing to feel like you're playing in time, and another to know with absolute confidence that you are. The metronome will tell you.
I would be surprised if anyone who tries and sticks with these exercises doesn't have a similar result. It just makes sense to me... It IS a mentally taxing exercise, but it's aimed directly at improving the most fundamental of musical skills.
You might not like hearing this, but the more difficult and frustrating these exercises are for you, the more likely it is you **really** need them. The upside is, you will be really glad you did!
Also, feel free to start with simpler music, I just chose what I happened to be working on this morning.
Good luck!
