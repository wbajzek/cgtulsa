Thanks to my friend <a href="http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/">Anton Emery</a>, I just read fingerstyle guitarist Adam Rafferty's <a href="http://adamrafferty.wordpress.com/2012/01/20/this-is-how-i-practice-guitar/">nice blog post about how he practices guitar</a>, in which he says:

> When I practice, I do it for the love of doing it.  I play my scales every day with attention to “form”, relaxation, groove and tone.  I run my repertoire for the delicacy and delight of playing with a deep satisfying rhythmic pocket and fingers that perfectly “touch” the strings.

> I plod along, day by day – and will do so for my whole life.  Day in, day out.  That’s what I do.  I practice for the love of practicing itself – with no result in mind.  This is how I practice guitar.

I have to agree. For me, the learning and experience is the key. Some days I really enjoy solving problems and developing my understanding, and some days I can just sit there for a half hour and just work on smoothing out one small aspect of technique. I find it more satisfying to accomplish one substantial thing than to try to chip away at a whole bunch of things.
