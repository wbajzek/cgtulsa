I just found this very nice video of Brigitte Zaczek on baroque lute. I'd never heard of her before but was &nbsp;intrigued because of her last name's similarity to my own. I find the interviewer to be a bit creepy, frankly, but I enjoyed the performance and the great footage of her right hand technique. It's especially interesting how she uses her right hand thumb to manage the beginning and end of every bass note. We have to do the same thing on guitar, too, but in comparison, we've really got it easy!

As a bonus, here's audio of her playing a piece by Mertz on a period instrument.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://3.gvt0.com/vi/6vlO3OLPnHM/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6vlO3OLPnHM&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/6vlO3OLPnHM&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div>
