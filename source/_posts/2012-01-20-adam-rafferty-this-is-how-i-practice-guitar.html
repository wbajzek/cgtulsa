Thanks to my friend&nbsp;<a href="http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/">Anton Emery</a>, I just read fingerstyle guitarist Adam Rafferty's <a href="http://adamrafferty.wordpress.com/2012/01/20/this-is-how-i-practice-guitar/">nice blog post about how he practices guitar</a>, in which he says:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: verdana, tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.7em; margin-top: 0.7em; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: left;">When I practice, I do it for the love of doing it.&nbsp; I play my scales every day with attention to “form”, relaxation, groove and tone.&nbsp; I run my repertoire for the delicacy and delight of playing with a deep satisfying rhythmic pocket and fingers that perfectly “touch” the strings.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: verdana, tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.7em; margin-top: 0.7em; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: left;">I plod along, day by day – and will do so for my whole life.&nbsp; Day in, day out.&nbsp; That’s what I do.&nbsp; I practice for the love of practicing itself – with no result in mind.&nbsp; This is how I practice guitar.</div></blockquote>I have to agree. For me, the learning and experience is the key. Some days I really enjoy solving problems and developing my understanding, and some days I can just sit there for a half hour and just work on smoothing out one small aspect of technique. I find it more satisfying to accomplish one substantial thing than to try to chip away at a whole bunch of things.</div>
