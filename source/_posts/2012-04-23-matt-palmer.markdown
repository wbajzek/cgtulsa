My wife and I drove four hours each way yesterday to see <a href="http://www.mattpalmerguitar.com/">Matt Palmer</a> perform in Kansas City, MO. My conclusion: it was well worth it! Matt's making a name for himself based on his impressive technique, but his tone, phrasing, and timing are wonderfully tasteful.

If you live anywhere near Kansas City and are not aware of the <a href="http://www.kansascityguitarsociety.org/">Kansas City Guitar Society</a>, you should make a point of connecting with them.
