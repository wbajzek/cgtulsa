If I could play all of it, I would decide it was OK to start learning it.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The problem was, I had unwittingly already started learning it in a lazy and unfocused manner and I'd probably ignored the fingerings, missed some dynamic markings, etc, figuring it was OK because I would address them when I started learning the piece for real. But&nbsp;I'd built in some habits already, and then readying a piece for performance was a process of unlearning the errors and shaping the piece the way I wanted it.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Well, I've had no time for that, so I had to just decide on an overall interpretation for the piece, break it down into manageable chunks and then commit to getting them to sound how I wanted ASAP. Then I could put the whole thing together and refine things from a more solid state of preparation.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The lesson is this:&nbsp;<b>The more attention paid and intention invested in the details at the beginning of the process, the quicker, better, and more consistent the results.&nbsp;</b></div></div>

Actually, I should clarify that. Finding faults is disappointing, but it also opens the door for improvement, and I&#39;m happy about that.</div>

Thanks Philip, that means an awful lot coming from you! <br /><br />I had other takes, later in the day, that were mostly better but with some horrible gaff. Learning a piece to record in one day is not really an ideal circumstance, but I&#39;m really glad to be doing this project. On the one hand, I am finding all kinds of faults with my playing, but on the other hand, I&#39;ll be making a dozen or more recordings of myself that I can actually enjoy listening to. It&#39;s giving me a confidence boost.</div>

Hey William, sounds really good! I like the phrasing and the loose feel, especially in the ending. And your hands look super light and relaxed. Congratulations!</div>
