Sorry for missing a few weeks of blogging. With a funeral to attend, a 5-day drive from my old home of Mount Vernon, WA to my new home in Tulsa, OK, then unpacking and getting my bearings, I haven't had much time to think about blogging. I promise to get back to it ASAP.<br /><br />Here's a quick tip. An hour before my guitar duo's last gig, I had a mishap with my nail file and basically stabbed myself in the quick, under my left pinky nail. It was painful and bloody.<br /><br />I took my duo partner's advice and put vitamin E oil on it, including under the nail as best as I could. It helped the wound heal within the next day, but it also <b>dulled the pain considerably</b>.&nbsp;I was able to play the gig without any trouble.</div>
