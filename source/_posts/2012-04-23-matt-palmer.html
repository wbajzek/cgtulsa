My wife and I drove four hours each way yesterday to see <a href="http://www.mattpalmerguitar.com/">Matt Palmer</a>&nbsp;perform in Kansas City, MO. My conclusion: it was well worth it! Matt's making a name for himself based on his impressive technique, but his tone, phrasing, and timing are wonderfully tasteful.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://1.gvt0.com/vi/M7v7zPYh37k/0.jpg"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/M7v7zPYh37k&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/M7v7zPYh37k&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div><br />If you live anywhere near Kansas City and are not aware of the <a href="http://www.kansascityguitarsociety.org/">Kansas City Guitar Society</a>, you should make a point of connecting with them.</div>
