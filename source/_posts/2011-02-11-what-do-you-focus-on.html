I managed to smash my left middle finger in the bathroom door on Monday night. I'm not sure how it happened, but I came out of it with a small cut and a numb fingertip. Yuck!<br /><br />So I decided to take it easy on practicing the next day and just play through my Bach Cello suite for fun. I sat down to play and got into my "I'm concentrating!" mode, and soon enough things were going ... well, not great. <br /><br />Frustrated, I decided to put the guitar away and do something else for a while. But I got bored and came back to the guitar to work on one of the movements that didn't go right. I started by playing through it again, and a funny thing happened.<br /><br />I got distracted somehow and found myself thinking I should start working on my taxes. Suddenly, I noticed that I was playing <b>great.</b> Huh? I played a few whole of the suite as well as I'd like to play them in concert. <br /><br />Thinking about my taxes is probably not the magic recipe for success, but I'm pretty sure that lightening up and letting go is part of it.<br /><br />What do you focus on when you perform? Listening to the sound? Visualizing what's ahead?</div>

&#39;Part of visualizing what&#39;s coming is &quot;hearing&quot; the music that&#39;s coming as well.&#39;<br /><br />That&#39;s true. Some people talk about visualizing (in the multi-sensory sense) ahead, like Shearer for example. <br /><br />Some people talk about just listening to the music as if you&#39;re in the audience. <br /><br />Pepe Romero says in his book something like, &quot;focus all your attention in the crown of your forehead and just trust your fingers to do what they&#39;ve been trained to do.&quot; <br /><br />I&#39;m curious as to what else others might do.</div>

I focus on visualizing what&#39;s coming.  It&#39;s a combination of looking ahead of my hands and imagining where I&#39;m going.  It&#39;s kind of a weird thing, but I sort of see my hand where it is currently and where it will be in next.<br /><br />Part of visualizing what&#39;s coming is &quot;hearing&quot; the music that&#39;s coming as well.</div>
