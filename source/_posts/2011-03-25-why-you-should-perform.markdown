> But actually, doing what other people expect you to is what’s overrated. The  external rewards for pursuing a dream may or may not arrive, but  regardless, you should feel proud of doing so. The first steps are more  important than the later ones, because they’ll provide inspiration and  security for everything that comes later. Just keep walking! 
>
>  Never despise small beginnings, and don’t belittle your own  accomplishments. Remember them and use them as inspiration as you go on  to the next thing. When you venture outside your comfort zone, wherever  the starting point may be, it’s kind of a big deal.

I recently commented on <a href="http://christopherguitar.com/">Chris Davis</a>'s post <a href="http://www.classicalguitarblog.net/2011/03/the-missing-ingredient-no-one-likes-to-talk-about/">"The missing ingredient no one likes to talk about"</a> that of all the musicians I've known, we classical guitarists seem like the least likely to get out and perform. We also complain about lack of public interest, diminishing ticket sales, etc. I bet these things are related. 


If you love classical guitar and you play classical guitar, you should get out there and perform.


Don't feel like it's not worth it if you can't sell out an auditorium. Don't feel like nobody will want to see you if you don't have a degree or haven't won a competition. Don't worry about trying to impress people.


Just have fun and do your best. You don't have to blow everyone's mind, just make someone smile.
