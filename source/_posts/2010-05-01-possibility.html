I'm reading another frustrating forum discussion about "am I limited because of ____"? The usual answers equate to, "of course you are. Just enjoy living within your limitation." The implied message is, "why even try?"<br /><br />Think of these two statements:<br />a) My potential is inevitably limited. <br />b) My potential is eventually unlimited.<br /><br />Which is more likely to get you motivated?</div>
