I wrote a <a href="http://www.classicalguitarblog.net/2010/10/concert-review-jorge-caballero-in-seattle-wa/">guest post for the Classical Guitar Blog</a> about Jorge Caballero's concert in Seattle last night.
I have to say, I miss the concert halls in the SF Bay Area. Petit Trianon and Herbst theater had really great acoustics, but I am not impressed with Benaroya Hall in Seattle. It just doesn't work as well for guitar.
