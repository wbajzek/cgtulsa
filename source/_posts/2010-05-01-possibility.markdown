I'm reading another frustrating forum discussion about "am I limited because of ____"? The usual answers equate to, "of course you are. Just enjoy living within your limitation." The implied message is, "why even try?"

Think of these two statements:

* My potential is inevitably limited. 
* My potential is eventually unlimited.

Which is more likely to get you motivated?
