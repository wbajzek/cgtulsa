Some things you practice may require a lot of repetition to train your muscle memory. It's tempting to just keep repeating an exercise thinking you're going to build up strength, but little errors will compound and turn your playing to mush.
Here's an effective way to get things done:
<ol><li>Get a **clear idea**  of what you're trying to do before you start. If you don't know what it should sound like, ask your teacher to demonstrate or find a recording of a piece which uses that technique. 
* Set your metronome to a speed where you can do the exercise as closely to that ideal as possible. When in doubt, err on the slow side. 
* Play the exercise a few times. Do it for maybe 10-15 seconds and stop. It's important, at this point, **not to worry about how it sounds**. 
* Take a break for a 10-15 seconds and relax. Recall that clear idea of what the exercise your playing should sound like. 
* Repeat steps 3 and 4 a few times, for about five or ten minutes.
* Take a longer break. 2-3 minutes. **Put the guitar down, stand up, think about something else for a bit. **
* Recall that ideal again. Repeat steps 3-6 until you run out of time or are ready to move on.</li></ol>In your next practice session, begin again at step one. The trick is to do it as much as possible in the time you have, but take little breaks so you stay focused and don't get tired. The breaks also give things a chance to sink in.

PS: I was recently contacted by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LFWOL">Jason Wehr</a>, another guitarist in town who saw my craigslist ad and liked my recordings. He sent me a link to his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LFWOL">youtube channel</a> and I liked his playing, so now we are working on duets together. Our first gig is December 8th at the Anacortes Museum, wish us luck!
