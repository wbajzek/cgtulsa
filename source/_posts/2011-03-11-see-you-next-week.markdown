I've been sick with flu and now bronchitis for more than a week now, and although I started writing my post for this week, I don't have the energy to give it all the thought it deserves. So here are some photos my wife <a href="http://castlerockduo.blogspot.com/">Angeline</a> took at our recent recital in Bellingham.
See you next week.
