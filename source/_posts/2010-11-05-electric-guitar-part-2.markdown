It's quite a different experience, beginning again but with so  many years of music experience behind me. It's not quite as fun as being a kid making loud noise for the first time but it's a lot more satisfying. Back then, I started off trying to learn Classical Gas on my  mom's nylon string guitar to convince my parents they should buy me an  electric guitar (which they did, even though my Classical Gas was  unrecognizable), then a pile of guitar magazines and a vague sense of music carried me on from there.

The first order of business is learning to use a pick again. Why the death-grip on the pick and the tension in my forearm? Even if I lighten up the grip the tension remains. Is it just  unfamiliar muscle work now and something that will go away on its own, or should I focus on this aspect right away since I'm aware of it?
