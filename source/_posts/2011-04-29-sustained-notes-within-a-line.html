This has come up a few times for me recently, and while it's not an original idea, I thought I'd share it for those who don't know about it.<br /><br />Classical guitar is a rather percussive instrument with quick decay, and often times the music we play has notes&nbsp;written&nbsp;within a line which are far longer than the instrument will actually sustain. Yet, when you hear this music played by a great guitarist (whose expensive guitar may or may not offer an extra millisecond of sustain), the line sounds unbroken.<br /><br />There are tricks for increasing sustain, vibrato can help, but this is what really makes it work. You need to <b>match the next note to the memory of the attack and tone of the sustained note</b>. Otherwise, if you accent it too much or too little, you may give the impression that you're starting a new phrase.<br /><br />Also, sometimes (especially in baroque or renaissance music), a voice can disappear for several measures before returning. To my ears, it's particularly effective when, for example, a piece with three voices sounds like they're the same three voices throughout. This doesn't mean there can't be dynamics or variation in the tone color, it's a matter of intention and attention to detail. I noticed this effect a lot with Paul Galbraith's Bach recordings.<br /><br />What it all boils down to is <b>that you should make a goal of matching the sound your create with the instrument with the intention you've got in your head</b>. Then you just need to listen a lot to great music and educate your imagination.<br /><br />--<br /><br />PS: I've concluded my video project, as I have to finish moving out of my house and am just too busy for the next few days. I will keep posting music I work on periodically, so please subscribe to my Youtube channel.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=CCBF8167D9AD5621">Here's a link to the playlist with all 13 videos I made this month.</a></div>
