A classical (nylon string) guitar is strongly preferred. Yamaha and Cordoba make great starter guitars. Adults, be sure to buy a full-size guitar. If you already have a guitar that’s not a classical, we can get you started on that.

Classical guitar is typically played with the guitar resting on the left leg, which rests on a footstool. So, you should have a footstool or a guitar support device such as the Dynarette cushion, Gitano, or Ergo-play.

Listen to a lot of classical guitar music but also lute, piano, violin, vocal, and chamber music. The guitar and its music have been influenced by other instruments and music throughout its history. Form opinions and come to your lesson with questions. Your attitude towards learning will have a huge effect on your ability to learn, so keep an open mind.

Good technique involves using just the right amount of tension necessary to play, and releasing that tension as soon as it’s no longer needed.
